# Future-weather-dashboard

For this assignment, we had to develop a weather dashboard that the when user types in a city in the search bar, in a card, the current weather is then displayed with the current temperature, humidity and wind speed. In another card, the weather for the next 5 days is also displayed with the same description as the current weather. 

After the user searches for multiple different cities, it is then stored in the local storage and in a list under the search bar where they can go back to the list and re click on the name if the city displayed instead of having to type it in again.

Kindly find attached a screen shot of the application and the deployed link to it.
